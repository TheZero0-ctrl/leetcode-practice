## Binary Trees
> A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, commonly referred to as the "left" child and the "right" child.
- Node at the top referred as the root node
- Any node that has no children is called a leaf node
- Height of a tree is the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to a leaf node
- Full binary tree is a binary tree in which every node has either zero or two children
