# - You want to buy apples and head to an apple store.
# - The store offers two pricing options:
#   - Buy one apple for $1.75.
#   - Choose from multiple pricing schemes where you buy a certain number of apples at a set price:
#     - Example: Three apples for $4.00, or two apples for $2.50.
# - Your objective is to purchase at least k apples while spending as little money as possible.
#
# Input:
# - Read test cases until there's no more input.
# - Each test case consists of the following lines:
#   - A line containing the price for buying one apple, followed by the number m of pricing schemes for this test case
#   m is at most 20.
#   - m lines, each providing a number n and total price p for purchasing n apples. n ranges between 1 and 100.
#   - A line containing integers, where each integer k ranges between 0 and 100 and
#   represents the desired number of apples to buy.
# Constraints:
# - Each price in the input is a floating-point number with exactly two decimal digits.
# Example:
# Given the problem description and the example pricing schemes, suppose we want to determine the minimum price for
# buying at least one apple and at least four apples, respectively. Hereâ€™s the input for this test case:
# ```
# 1.75 2
# 3 4.00
# 2 2.50
# 1 4
# ```
# Output:
# For each test case, output the following:
# - A line containing Case c:, where c is the number of the test case starting at 1.
# - For each integer k, a line containing Buy k for $d, where d is the cheapest cost for
# which we can buy at least k apples.
# Example Output:
# ```
# Case 1:
# Buy 1 for $1.75
# Buy 4 for $5.00
# ```
